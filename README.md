# Stock Price Prediction

Stop Price Prediction is implemented using Deep Learning Models(ConvLSTM, Bidirectional LSTM etc.,) for Univariate and Multivariate Analysis. 

# Technologies Used
-> Python 3.8\
-> Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6\
-> Keras 2.7\
-> TensorFlow 2.7.0\
-> Numpy 1.11.0\
-> Matplotlib 3.1\
-> Pywebio 1.5.2

# Features
-> User can predict the stock Price based on the past data.\
-> User can reset the value they entered.
